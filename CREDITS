        In a similar fashion to the Linux source tree
        this file contains a list of contributors
        with a description of their contributions.
        See `CONTRIBUTING` for a description of how to
        get added.
        The list is sorted alphabetically by username and
        formatted to allow easy grepping and beautification
        by scripts. The fields are: username (U), name (N),
        email (E), web-address (W), and description (D).
        Thanks,
